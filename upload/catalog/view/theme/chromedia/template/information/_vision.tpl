    <p class="blog-p"><strong>Learning from each other has always been essential to distributed progress.</p>

    <p class="blog-p">Rather than thinking of ideas as private property, we view innovation as a public resource that can be made available to the commons for everyone’s benefit.</p>

<p class="blog-p"> When designs, code, datasets, guides and instructions are openly accessible, people can more easily build and improve upon existing innovation as users, developers, and makers. This inspires the growth of global networks of collaboration, where entrepreneurs in Spain or Guatemala or China work together to co-develop products that they can each sell in their local markets under their own unique branding (no-strings franchising).</p>

    <p class="blog-p">Sharing knowledge freely is an open invitation to everyone and anyone to help each other innovate solutions to humanity’s most pressing needs, and we all benefit.</p>
