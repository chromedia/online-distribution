    <p class="blog-p"><strong>Imagine a world where almost all the products we use are manufactured locally using sustainable practices</strong>. We work with people throughout the world to achieve this.</p>

    <p class="blog-p">Rather than thinking of ideas as private property, we view innovation as a public resource that can be made available to the commons for everyone’s benefit. This inspires the growth of global networks of collaboration, where entrepreneurs in Spain or Guatemala or China work together to co-develop products that they can each sell in their local markets under their own unique branding (no-strings franchising).</p>

    <p class="blog-p">Entrepreneurship is our greatest weapon against poverty and the destruction of the environment. Allowing others to manufacture products we design helps them create businesses where they live, anywhere in the world, and vice versa. In return, we have potential partners in innovation in every corner of the planet. Forgoing the right to patent is like an open invitation to everyone and anyone to help us innovate solutions to humanity’s most pressing needs, and we all benefit.</p>
