  <p class="blog-p">We develop <strong>open source commercial products</strong> and provide <strong>public education programs</strong>. All of our work is designed to have a social benefit. For each product we design, we publish its source documentation <em>(3D models, fabrication diagrams, bills of materials, instructional videos, etc.)</em> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">100% free and open source license</a>. While we are still in our first year of development, we have multiple open hardware projects that are nearly ready for beta testing as of January 1, 2014, and we have hosted a number of workshops and community events that are aimed at economic development and environmental restoration.</p>

  <p class="blog-p">In the future, we will most likely establish a nonprofit and for-profit hybrid organization. Both will have a charitable purpose and will be organized to provide a social benefit, but the nonprofit will allow for individuals and foundations to grant tax-deductible contributions to our work, while the for-profit branch will fund our operations through the commercialization of products and services.</p>
